# Intribox

## What is this?

Intribox is a secure "self-hostable" media backup service. Every pictures or video you upload to it is end-to-end encrypted by your password so the server owner has no direct access to what you uploaded to it.

In other words, a end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Photos

### Explanation of the stack

The webserver is made in Golang while the front-end is made using React and Redux for state management. The encryption is done almost the same way as Bitwarden. More explanation coming soon.
